# MDPPP - Monkeypox Detection using Skin Lesion Images

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook `MDPPP.ipynb`, which demonstrates a machine learning approach for detecting Monkeypox through skin lesion image classification.

## 📘 Project Overview

The notebook includes:

- 📥 Loading and preprocessing image data
- 🖼️ Visualizing skin lesion samples
- 🧠 Building and training deep learning models for image classification
- 📉 Evaluating model performance using metrics and plots
- 💾 Saving trained models for inference

This project aims to build a reliable model for the early detection of Monkeypox using skin lesion images, aiding in fast and efficient diagnosis.

## 📂 Dataset Used

The dataset used in this project is the **Monkeypox Skin Lesion Dataset**, sourced from Kaggle:

🔗 [Monkeypox Skin Lesion Dataset by nafin59](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nafin59/monkeypox-skin-lesion-dataset)

It contains categorized images of skin lesions, including:

- Monkeypox
- Chickenpox
- Measles
- Normal skin

The dataset is essential for training models to distinguish between similar-looking skin conditions.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Scikit-learn
- OpenCV (optional, if used for preprocessing)
